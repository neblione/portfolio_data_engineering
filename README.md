Hello and welcome!  
I’m Eduardo, and this is my **Data Engineering portfolio**.  
Here I share projects I’ve worked on, where I had the opportunity to explore different tools,  
architectures, and data processing techniques.  

If you have any questions or want to connect, feel free to reach out —  
I’ll be glad to help and exchange knowledge! 

## Tech Stack 

These are the main tools and frameworks I work with in my projects,  
covering ETL, cloud, data lakes, orchestration, and BI.

## Project Index

In this section, you will find a curated list of my Data Engineering projects,  
each with a brief description and a direct link to the repository or folder.  
The goal is to showcase practical applications of modern tools, techniques,  
and best practices across different data scenarios.
